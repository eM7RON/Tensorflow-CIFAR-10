There are three folders: models, test set and visualizations. The Jupyter notebook is
setup to use these folders so they do not require any unpacking.

There are instructions to setup the python environment I used and instructions on the running 
of the code in the notebook.

The 'Report.pdf' file is a short 3-side-report of the experimentation in the jupyter notebook.
